# Moneybags ðŸ’°

Moneybags is an open-source cashflow management system used for creating tax invoices. Most of the solutions on the market today cost exorbitant amounts of money or are obtained via silly subscription models. Let's change that :3

### Latest release

### Using Moneybags
Create a Persona (.mbpersona file) and never worry about having to enter basic details like your name or ABN or postal address again with the `Persona Creator`. After doing that, head over to the `Invoice Creator` to begin. It's straightforward from there!
